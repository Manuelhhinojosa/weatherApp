🌦️ Weather App

This is a simple yet stylish weather web app that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API. Made for quick weather checks without the clutter — just pure forecast, clean UI, and zero fluff.

🌐 About the Project

This project was built as a school assignment to demonstrate API consumption, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive front-end design. It allows users to:

- 🔍 Search any city
- ☁️ View current weather conditions
- 🌡️ See temperature, humidity, and more
- 📲 Enjoy a responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile

This one’s a straight-up vanilla JS flex — no frameworks, no libraries (aside from Axios), just clean code and weather facts.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🌀 Real-Time API Integration
